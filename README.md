# PoseTime
A simple android timer meant to be used with figure drawing.

A main timer counts down common pose intervals (30s, 3 minutes, etc.)
A number of poses can also be entered, and the timer will automatically count down all poses.

The timer is large so that it could be started/stopped easily (such as with the model's toe).
Large numbers and simple colors make it possible for the artists to see remaining time.
